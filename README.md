### **CEER**  
***Halo CE Enemy Randomiser***

Randomises enemies in Halo CE for MCC. 

More info in this video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17N8_E40Nl0)

Requires [Cheatengine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) to be installed.
Remember to run MCC with anticheat disabled.

Supports current patch (v2904) as of 19th of August, 2022, as well as Season 8 (v2645).

The "Don't Randomise Popcorn" setting makes it so popcorn (infection forms) can't get randomised into other enemies. I recommend leaving this option disabled to make for a more fun (and chaotic, and challenging) experience, but YMMV. 

COOP:
To play coop, both players must use the "Set Seed" setting, and use the exact same seed. Preferably activate the randomiser while still in the lobby menu.
